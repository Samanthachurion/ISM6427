# Italy Itinerary

A simple trip planner for Italy using Google Maps.

1. Type a **place name** and its **address**.
2. The app finds it on the map, **groups stops by city**, and puts each city's stops in an
   easy order (each next stop is the closest one left).
3. Click **Open in Google Maps** next to a city to get walking directions for that day.

Stops are saved in your browser.

## Google Maps key

In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis), create an API key
and turn on **Maps JavaScript API** and **Geocoding API**. Then either:

- paste it into `config.js`, or
- paste it into the "Google Maps key" box in the app.

Restrict the key to your Netlify website address (HTTP referrers) so others can't use it.
Without a key, addresses are still found (using OpenStreetMap) and listed, but the map is hidden.

## Deploy on Netlify

Plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step. Drag this `itinerary` folder into Netlify Drop, or deploy the
whole repo and open `/itinerary/`.
